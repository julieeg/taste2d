Meeting Notes

IDEAS
* case-influential statistics for regression models
* add boxplots of glucose ~ fasting time
* SES adjustment, as a variable identified as being very different between the two 24HR groups..and glucose; first, see if SES associates with glucose


8/28/2024 - JEG/SJC ============

Topics discussed
- Relayed concerns about ≠ based on 24HR availability
- Also discussed potential for batch effects (collection date, time between collection to assay (glucose amounts are changeable in the time between blood collection and assay which could be explaining systematically higher RG values if 24HR participants had more immediate blood assays than others who did not do the full phenotyping
- Realized that the fasting variable was only grabbed for visit 1** need to upate this
- talked about the general importance of a finding that the UKB glucose variable might have systematic bias, and if so, a "Letter to the Editor" could be neccessary
- both agreed that the project was intellectually sound, interesting and rooted in a good biological basis (!) but that this is just frustrating 

Next steps
* Read the UKB manual for glucose (biochemical & NMR) data collection, processing and harmonization --> check for correction factors, or notes that might explain a systematic difference at t0 for 24HR completers/non-completers - DONE 8/28
* After identifying covariates;
** Summarize: assay time, collection date, time ≠ assay difference, center, batch by 24HR reporters/non-reporters - DONE 8/29
** Add covariates to models of glu_msr ~ TAS2R38 to see impact on main effect
** Run sensitivity analyses to exclude ppl based on assay performance metrics 
** Look at BM~NMR correlations (but first, confirm if they are from the SAME blood sample) within 24HR reporters/non-reporters; and across batches and assay time/run differences
 

8/27/2024 - JEG/MUD ============

Topics discussed
- JEG showed MUD the spurious differenced in RG and 02hrG by 24HR data plausibility; Decided on next steps
-- Repeat analysis using other glucose measures (NMR metabolomics measure & measures at second time point) for comparison
-- Consider reaching out to Magda regarding the fasting time variable for NMR and whether this is the same as the biochemical data
-- Look into study-wide covariates for NMR (or Biochemical) data that should be adjusted for (e.g., batch, assay date, time, location/center)

Next steps
* Repeat analysis with NMR and t0/t1 data for both measures
* Examine differences in RG (for each measure) by fasting time & run associations with TAS2R38 SNPs 

Notes
- While re-running analyses, I added a FLAG FOR RG >|5SD| --> this is the main distinction between v2 to v3
-- Before, RG maximum was ~16.5; with SD cut-offs, now the maximum is ~10 (or 12?
-- With this change, ~577 participants were removed; and the association in the total sample with RG became significant


6/24/2024 - JEG/MUD =================

Topics discussed
-Need to validate the diplotye/diet associations - "Nonstarter, if the diplotypes are not associated with the same diet traits (?)
-Focus on similarities in diet across ANC groups
-Run all analyses again, stratifying by ANC group and each DIPLO (not just the 3 primary) 
-- 1) First, make sure the AVI/AVI and PAV/PAV are present in all ANC and really do represent NT/STs
-- 1b) Use this as an internal validation to show that the same diplotypes are correlated with less/more coffee
-- 2) Then, run with glucose to determine which diplotypes are the right ones to 'bring forward'
-- 3) Build composite bitter food traits (using PCA? clustering? including coffee, tea, vegetables etc)


Keep in mind
-Adjusting for BMI is a GOOD THING because it can be thought of as an indicator for fasting glucose (so need to show correlation of bmi // FG)
- Review Nat Genetics paper by Amit Kerr on PRS/lifestyle scores and weighting


## Aug 14 ===================
- Aiming to have a FULL DRAFT BY 1 WEEK***
- Goals for now are to finalise the results section and get the writing along with it. You also need to come to a final choice about samples and see if you can understand why the RG associations were significant in the initial models but not at all here....????
