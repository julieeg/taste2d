Meeting Notes


6/2X/2024 - JEG/MUD

Topics discussed
-Need to validate the diplotye/diet associations - "Nonstarter, if the diplotypes are not associated with the same diet traits (?)
-Focus on similarities in diet across ANC groups
-Run all analyses again, stratifying by ANC group and each DIPLO (not just the 3 primary) 
-- 1) First, make sure the AVI/AVI and PAV/PAV are present in all ANC and really do represent NT/STs
-- 1b) Use this as an internal validation to show that the same diplotypes are correlated with less/more coffee
-- 2) Then, run with glucose to determine which diplotypes are the right ones to 'bring forward'
-- 3) Build composite bitter food traits (using PCA? clustering? including coffee, tea, vegetables etc)


Keep in mind
-Adjusting for BMI is a GOOD THING because it can be thought of as an indicator for fasting glucose (so need to show correlation of bmi // FG)
- Review Nat Genetics paper by Amit Kerr on PRS/lifestyle scores and weighting


## Aug 14 ===================
- Aiming to have a FULL DRAFT BY 1 WEEK***
- Goals for now are to finalise the results section and get the writing along with it. You also need to come to a final choice about samples and see if you can understand why the RG associations were significant in the initial models but not at all here....????
